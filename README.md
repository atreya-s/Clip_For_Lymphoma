# Clip For Lymphoma
This project involved trying to use CLIP (OpenAI) for the detection of different lymphoma types

Next goals:
 - Try and make an HDF5 backend for the data - similar to what was done in the dense net blogpost
    HDF5 backend is not properly optimized - need to go over data preprocessing (CODE from paper is not optimal)
 - Figure out why the classification is so bad (?)
